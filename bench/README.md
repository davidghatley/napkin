# Engine measurements

These scripts drive the real server, store, esbuild and canvas page. Chromium is headless with
`--disable-gpu` (CPU only). Every listener starts on port 0, except the restart tests, which
bring a server back on the port it had. No dependencies were added.

The harness (corpus, perf, soak) was first built by Codex against an older core; it was then
rebuilt here on the current canvas (shared React runtime, session tokens, hash revisions,
`src/chromium.js`).

```sh
node bench/corpus.js --size 40            # prints the temp folder it made; remove it when done
node bench/perf.js                        # PRF-01..08 and REL-05; one row: --id PRF-02
node --test test/engine/                  # REL-03 reconnect + shared-runtime tests (EVIDENCE=1 records the REL-03 text)
node bench/soak.js --duration 1800 --size 200 --interval 1000 --seed 1729   # REL-04
```

Each measured row writes `docs/evidence/<ID>.json` (raw samples, machine, method, SHA-256
of the measured sources) and `<ID>.txt` (result and the exact re-run command). A missed bar
exits nonzero after the measurements are written; `node bench/perf.js` runs every row even
when one misses. Generated TSX never goes into git. The branch-switch row stages and commits
only inside its generated temp repo.

Default `npm test` skips the expensive workloads. To run them as tests:

```sh
PERF=1 node --test test/engine/bench.test.js
SOAK=1 node --test test/engine/bench.test.js     # 60 s soak, writes REL-04-60s only
```

## Methods

- `PRF-01` starts the clock before the server spawns and stops it after all 40 sections are
  ready, every expected cell holds its component, there are zero build/render errors and two
  animation frames have run. Chromium launch is excluded; the OS file cache is not flushed.
- `PRF-02`, `PRF-03`, `PRF-08` use wall-clock times (`performance.timeOrigin + performance.now()`)
  so a separate MCP process and the page share a clock. "Painted" means: the new value is in
  every cell of the edited component, layout is forced, then two `requestAnimationFrame`
  callbacks have run (a conservative paint proxy, not a physical display). 40 trials, the first
  10 are warm-up and not counted, nearest-rank p95. The edited component is revealed at its own
  size first, with 200 components (1,131 cells) loaded; an edit to a component that is off-screen
  is deliberately not drawn until it scrolls into view.
  - `PRF-02` types a new default for a setting and presses Tab; timed from that key event.
  - `PRF-03` is an MCP `apply_edits` call from another process.
  - `PRF-08` types into the padding field with focus kept; timed from the `input` event to the
    selected node showing the new padding (the canvas previews while you type; the edit is written
    on commit).
- `PRF-04` sends real wheel events for five seconds (a Ctrl-wheel zoom every twelfth) and records
  rAF intervals; the benchmark never injects a transform.
- `PRF-05`/`PRF-06` apply 2,000 real `store.apply` edits to a 200-component workspace and time
  the incremental esbuild rebuild and the whole apply-to-bundle path. Edit #1 and #2000 are kept.
- `PRF-07` samples the server's `VmRSS` and the page's live JS heap after an explicit GC.
- `REL-04`: two concurrent agents choose seeded random components and valid edits for the
  duration; every accepted revision (or a newer one) must reach the page; all files are parsed
  each minute and at the end; RSS growth is the largest sample against the post-warm-up baseline.
- `REL-05` runs an actual `git checkout` in a generated temp repo that changes all 40 files.
